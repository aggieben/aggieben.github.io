I'm a defense-industry dropout, former Microsoftie, and former [Stacker](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2013/07/say-hi-to-nine-of-our-newest-newbies/).  Today I'm contracting and running [Trinity Republic](http://trinityrepublic.com), a consulting business I've started with a partner to bootstrap something super-secret (so secret even I don't know what it is yet).

You can find me in a number of places on the interwebs: [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/u/3279), [GitHub](https://github.com/aggieben), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aggieben), and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/bcollins).
